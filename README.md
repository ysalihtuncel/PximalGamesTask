 Hyper Casual Task Game


The player starts at the entrance of an outdoor warehouse holding an empty pallet.
As the player moves forward, he may pick up boxes from the ground, adding them to his/her stack of boxes
The playerâ€™s main goal is to pick up the boxes and stack them on top of each other.
At the end of the level, the player places boxes on a truck that he/she has stacked so far while playing an animation.
The box/s that hit the obstacle with red color should be shattered and the boxes on top should be removed from the stack.
